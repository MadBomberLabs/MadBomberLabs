		<div class="bodyPar">
			<h2 class="text-center">People</h2>
			Mad Bomber Labs is a company that was founded on the idea of helping small businesses. The services we offer started as a hobby, and through
				hard work and many hours at a keyboard, MBL evolved into what it is today. What is that exactly? Simply put, we are a company that takes
				care of its own, its customers, and its members. Since we are a multi-faceted company, it is important to us that we put people first.
		</div>
			
		<div class="bodyPar">
			<h2 class="text-center">Knowledge</h2>
			We strive to grow and continue to expand our knowldge base and skill set. As a growing company, we dedicate ourselves to our work so that we
				can keep up with changing technologies and platforms for our customers. Because MBL specializes in Home and Small Business environments,
				there are some limitations to our services and knowledge. However, there is nothing that we won't try to solve for our customers. If 
				there is a need, we will find a way to meet it.
		</div>
			
		<div class="bodyPar">
			<h2 class="text-center">Pride</h2>
			MBL was founded by an Army Veteran. To the company, that means that success is our only option. To our customers and our members, it means
				that you can expect a level of pride that compares to none other, dedication to every aspect of business, and a work ethic that can only
				be measured by our reputation. The army teaches soldiers to put the mission first, and Mad Bomber Labs is no different. We support our 
				nation by supporting the small businesses supporting her. We are all proud to be a part of something bigger than ourselves here at MBL.
