		<h3>Electronic Repair</h3>
		<p>Every single one of us has dropped our phones, stepped on our tablets, spilled drinks on our laptops, or had game consoles
			stop working! Fortunately, Mad Bomber Labs has the knowledge and experience to help!</p>
		<p>Some devices are too old to be worth repair, or sometimes they have just sat around for too long without being used. If you
			have old electronic equipment laying around, contact us for a quote of purchase!</p>
		<p>Do you have a computer that died? Or maybe just a hard drive that you need data recovered from? We can troubleshoot computer
			failure and even have the equipment to replace or recover data on hard drives!</p>
		<p>MBL technicians will do their best to ensure that you have a working device! We are working on a loaner program for extended or 
			complicated repairs. Until then, we will be sure to put quality in our work before speed, but will work with a sense of urgency
			for each and every device we repair.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="webDevelopment" class="tabcontent">
		<h3>Web Development</h3>
		<p>If you have a small business and don't have a website yet, or maybe you just aren't happy with your existing website, Mad Bomber Labs
			can fix that for you! We will work with you to make sure you are happy with a website that represents you!</p>
		<p>MBL will be happy to host and manage your website as well! If that isn't something you would be interested in, we can recommend
			great alternatives to purchase a domain name and have your site hosted. We will ensure that the site you've built to represent
			your company is ready for viewers before our business is complete! If you need your own email, we recommend utilizing an existing
			email solution. However, we have added email server administration to our plethora of skills and hope to fine tune it so that we
			can suggest ourselves for all your email needs soon!</p>
		<p>Recently, MBL has taken on App Development as well! If you need an app for your business, we now offer our services to get it done!
			If you have the next brilliant app idea, let us know, and we may be able to work with you to get it built and on the app store!
			Right now, we specialize in Apple products, but we have plans to grow into the Android market as well!</p> 
	</div>

	<div id="networkConsultation" class="tabcontent">
		<h3>Network Consultation</h3>
		<p>Are you one of the millions of Americans that have less than satisfying internet speeds? Are you not seeing the speeds you're paying 
			for? Mad Bomber Labs can offer consulting services to ensure that your home or small business network is running efficiently and 
			at the speeds it should be!</p>
		<p>When we have many devices on a network, it can get complicated and messy to set up. When you have a cable company's "expert" set up 
			your network, they don't always have the knowledge or your best interest in mind. MBL can make sure all your devices are set up properly 
			and that you don't throw your money away on things you don't need, or on devices that aren't doing the right job!</p>
		<p>MBL will help design, and even build and maintain your network for you. We can teach you how to maintain your network yourself, and how to 
		protect it. From small applications to servers and multiple offices, we can get you where you need to be!
	</div>
	
	<div id="automotiveServices" class="tabcontent">
		<h3>Automotive Services</h3>
		<p>You may already be wondering why we have included automotive repair in our list of services. Its alright, we came prepared! At first, 
			the guys at MBL started working on cars as a hobby. In fact, we still do! When MBL was started, we had lots of projects to work on from 
			our own cars and motorcycles, to our friends and families' vehicles. Now, we offer all sorts of automotive solutions.</p>
		<p>If you live in the Ransomville, New York area, contact us or stop by! We may have to refer you to a mechanic that is more prepared to 
			handle complex work, but we will be more than happy to take a look and possibly save you money! We give the same attention to detail to 
			automotive customers as we do our computer clients.</p>
		<p>What can we do exactly? We have the ability to do tire replacement and balancing, all servicing, and most custom work. Anything from 
			performance modifications, to winter tires, to debugging that pesky check engine light! The best way to see if we can help you is to 
			send us a chat when we are online, or contact us from one of the options on the <a href="/navPages/contact.php">contact</a> page!</p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="customAudioInstallation" class="tabcontent">
		<h3>Custom Audio Installation</h3>
		<p>This is another service that may be a little curious. However, similar to automotive services, custom audio started as a hobby that quickly 
			became a marketable skill! With a taste of an electrical engineering education, and experience as a bomb technician and construction, we 
			have the ability and knowledge to help with custom home, office, and automotive audio!</p>
		<p>Not all audio applications require an expert. However, especially in automotive audio, it can be confusing and expensive to build a system 
			that suits your needs and your budget. A small mistake can cost quality audio and sometimes can destroy expensive audio components. We can 
			help make good decisions before they turn into expensive choices!</p>
		<p>Get ahold of a member of MBL from our <a href="/public_html/contact.php">contact</a> options today, and we can help point you in the right 
			direction. Like all our other services, if we don't have a solution that fits your needs, we will gladly do the research to become proficient, 
			or we will point you in the direction of a reputable person or company that will get you to where you need to be!</p>
